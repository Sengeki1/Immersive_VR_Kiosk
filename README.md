<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e2fa7d8-ecb2-46e3-be8d-718bb29e8fd0" align="center">

## Introduction

Welcome to the Immersive Virtual Reality Kiosk project, a Unity-based VR application designed for the Meta Quest headset and keyboard/mouse navigation. This interactive experience simulates a virtual kiosk that allows users to explore, interact with, and purchase items in an immersive environment. With intuitive controls and an engaging 3D world, the application redefines how users interact with virtual kiosks.

### Features

- **Dual Control Modes**: Use VR controllers or keyboard/mouse for navigation and interactions.
- **Interactive Environment**: Explore a fully interactive VR world.
- **Grabbable and Usable Items**: Interact with kiosk items in a realistic way.
- **Optimized for VR**: Designed for smooth performance on the Meta Quest.
- **Customizable Layout**: Modify the kiosk’s items and layout to suit your needs.

## How to Use

### Navigation
- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - Use `W` to move forward.
  - Use `S` to move backward.
  - Use `A` to move left.
  - Use `D` to move right.

### Interaction
1. Press `2` to select the **left hand** or `3` to select the **right hand**.
2. Use the `W`, `S`, `A`, `D` keys to position the selected hand/controller.
3. **Mouse Interaction**:
   - Click the mouse button to press on an item.
4. If you are done using the hands/controllers, press `1` to deactivate them.

## Build Instructions

### Build Instructions
1. Install Unity version **2022.3.16f1**.
2. Install VRTK version **VRTK v4**.
3. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sengeki1/Immersive_Virtual_Reality.git
   cd Immersive_Virtual_Reality
   ```
4. Open the project in Unity.
5. Set the target platform to Android (for Meta Quest) or Windows (for desktop testing). If target platform is for Meta Quest, ensure that ``UnityXRPluginFramework`` is enabled and ``CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator`` is disabled. One can do this by clicking Toggle Active State.
6. Build and deploy using Unity’s build tools.

## Discussion: Simulator vs. Headset Experience

The experience of interacting with the application in a VR simulator compared to the actual headset is vastly different.  
### Simulator:
- Allows quick testing of functionality without requiring the headset.
- Mouse and keyboard controls enable precise debugging.
- Lacks full immersion due to the absence of head and hand tracking.

### Headset:
- Provides full immersion, leveraging the Quest’s capabilities.
- Interaction feels natural, with precise hand-tracking and spatial awareness.
- Visual and audio fidelity are optimized for the user, creating a more engaging experience.
